ChessSweeper
============

MineSweeper + Chess, written in AS3 with Adobe Air via Flash CS6

This is a game that blends two classic games into one: MineSweeper and Chess. By moving a piece to a mine, the piece explodes. This adds the challenge of not just concerning oneself with the other pieces on the board, but the board itself. This also adds a humor factor to the game, as it is rather entertaining to watch pieces explode.

10 mines randomly spawn, including underneath pieces. They are only triggered by moving on to the mine. If a king trips a mine, the other player instantly wins. Once a mine is tripped, the spot is safe to move to with other pieces. The game ends at check mate.

TODO:
Castling
Checking (right now you can simply take their king which works out rather well suprisingly)
AI -- could be difficult since this would have to be a blend of Chess AI and MineSweeper AI
